Do you know what it is ,  and where I can get one ?  We suspect you had seen the Terrex Autospade ,  which is made by Wolf Tools .  It is quite a hefty spade , with bicycle - type handlebars and a sprung lever at the rear , which you step on to <head>activate</head> it . Used correctly ,  you should n't have to bend your back during general digging ,  although it wo n't lift out the soil and put in a barrow if you need to move it !  If gardening tends to give you backache ,  remember to take plenty of rest periods during the day ,  and never try to lift more than you can easily cope with .

For neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists ,  the way forward in understanding perception has been to correlate these dimensions of experience with ,  firstly ,  the material properties of the experienced object or event  ( usually regarded as the stimulus )  and ,  secondly ,  the patterns of discharges in the sensory system .  Qualitative Aspects of Experience The quality or modality of the experience depends less upon the quality of energy reaching the nervous system than upon which parts of the sensory system are <head>activated</head> : stimulation of the retinal receptors causes an experience of light ; stimulation of the receptors in the inner ear gives rise to the experience of sound ; and so on . Muller 's  nineteenth - century  doctrine of specific energies  formalized the ordinary observation that different sense organs are sensitive to different physical properties of the world and that when they are stimulated ,  sensations specific to those organs are experienced .  It was proposed that there are endings  ( or receptors )  within the nervous system which are attuned to specific types of energy ,  For example ,  retinal receptors in the eye respond to light energy ,  cochlear endings in the ear to vibrations in the air ,  and so on .

Figure 5.11 ( b )  shows an increase in the areas a  and b  with a consequent reduction in the proportion  ( although not the absolute number )  of c  elements activated by a stimulus .  figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .  There is no net increase in the number of elements <head>activated</head> by a given stimulus but the circles have been moved apart , indicating not only an increase in the number of unique elements <head>activated</head> by a stimulus but a corresponding decrease in the number of common elements <head>activated</head> . It is not clear if either of these possibilities accurately represents the full implications of Gibson 's   ( 1969 )  differentiation theory ,  but both are capable of predicting the required result .  * Comparing the scheme shown in fig. 5.11 ( b )  with that of Fig. 5.11 ( a )  ,  we might expect that the presence of the extra active a  elements would produce more effective overshadowing of the c  elements during training with A. Generalization to B would therefore be reduced .

She realised that this was not a woman to whom one chatted about shops or clothes .  Jane had not visited her on impulse ,  nor yet as a premeditated plan .  She was <head>activated</head> by something in between . To show Christopher the human face of the dreaded development .  IF she could persuade him to come ,  which she doubted .
